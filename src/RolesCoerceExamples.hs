-- | fmap a list of integers and constructing list Sum types

slowSum :: [Int] -> Int
slowSum = getSum . mconcat . fmap Sum

-- | this is O(0) time using coerce
-- converting [Int] -> [Sum] since their representation in
-- memory is same ; this is also used in newtype types
-- if the functor (e.g []) is polymorphic then coerce
-- will not work since it will not know what type a  will be
-- but there is also unsafecoerce 
-- for cases you guarantee the type of a has same representation
-- with the converted type b
fastSum :: [Int] -> Int
fastSum = getSum . mconcat . coerce

-- | since Coercible uses representational equality
-- it follows laws of equality;
{- 
  * Reflexivityâ€”Coercible a a is true for any type a
  * Symmetryâ€”Coercible a b implies Coercible b a
  * Transitivityâ€”given Coercible a b and Coercible b c
    we have Coercible a c

-- | examples to show if it is safe to coerce 
-- representationally equal types
-- example uses a container Map (from Data.Map)
